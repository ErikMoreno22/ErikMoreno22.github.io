        <h3><i><u> StrangerLove </u></i></h3>
        <div class="p3"> 
                StrangeLove Skateboards has crafted its own unique aesthetic by combining 
            <br> chaotic creative expression with a grounded appreciation for what makes 
            skate <br> fun. The quirky, California-based label now links up with Nike SB
            to lend its <br> uncommon perspective to a cherished style: the Dunk Low. 
            This drop sees the <br> design dressed in textured velvet with overlays of 
            suede. Permeated with pastel,<br> the makeup blends seductive shades of soft
            pink with hits of bright melon and <br> gym red. StrangeLove literally leaves 
            its mark with embroidered skull illustrations <br> on each heel. On the sole,
            understated heart graphics show love, just in time for <br> Valentineâ€™s Day. 
            Theese expensive shoes are made  for skating thought are so <br> expensives 
            and excluisves.  lot of people buys them just for teir collections
            and <br> do not even use them and other people   sell them for 
            more than they bought and <br> earn some money.</p>
